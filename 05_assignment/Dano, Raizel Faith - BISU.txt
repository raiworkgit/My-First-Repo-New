Reflection and comments.

The task is easy but I took breaks in between cause I couldn't do it in one sitting so it probably took me an hour or 2 including the breaks. 

One challenge I faced during the activity was properly structuring the form elements, such as aligning radio buttons before the choices and placing questions inside a box. I initially struggled with positioning but resolved it by using the <fieldset> and <legend> tags to group related inputs.
